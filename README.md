# 📊 Data Science Journey

Welcome to my **Data Science Journey** 🚀  

This repository is a comprehensive collection of **projects, notebooks, and experiments** that document my end-to-end journey of becoming a **Data Scientist**. It reflects my hands-on learning, practice, and growth across the entire data science ecosystem.

Unlike my other repositories (which focus on specific tools or learning topics), this repo serves as a **central portfolio** of real, applied projects built over time.

## 🧭 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my **progress and learning evolution**
- Apply concepts through **real-world projects**
- Build a **portfolio** showcasing practical data science skills
- Experiment, fail, learn, and improve continuously

This repo will evolve as I evolve.
